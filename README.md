# 👋 Hi, I'm Ethan Millstein

Lead Software Engineer with 8+ years of experience building scalable web and mobile applications.

I specialize in React Native, full-stack product delivery, and clean architectural thinking — helping teams ship faster without sacrificing long-term maintainability. I thrive in roles that blend execution, product instinct, and engineering leadership.  

I’ve led core projects across B2B, consumer, and internal tools — with an emphasis on clarity, scalability, and product-first thinking.
